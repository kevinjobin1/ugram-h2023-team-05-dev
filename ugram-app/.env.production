# This file contains all the environment variables needed (or supported) by the

# it and use it as a base to build their own `.env` file.
#
# Current project developers should try to fill the values with the most
# generic information possible for future developers.
#
# Personal values (such as access and secret keys) should *not* be stored in
# this file since theyâ€™re not shared among developers.
